    1. ** Load the Diabetic dataset ** using sklearn
    2. ** split the data** (80% train / 20% test)
    3. ** Train a linear regresion model.**
    4. ** Find the best 3-features combination **(lowest RMSE) for the model
    5. ** Find the R2 and adjusted R2** for the model
    6. ** Apply feature engineering ** if needed
    7. ** List the top 5 models based on RMSE**
    8. ** Output the results in structured format**
